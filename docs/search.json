The syntax for writing math is very similar to the syntax used in the \\(\\LaTeX\\) markup language. For example, $f(x) \\approx y$ renders to \\(f(x) \\approx y\\). To place complex mathematical expressions on their own lines, use double dollar signs. For example, the expression\n$$\\mathcal{L}(a, b) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n (ax_i + b - y_i)^2$$\nrenders to:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}(a, b) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n (ax_i + b - y_i)^2\\;.\\]\nBehind the scenes, math is powered by the MathJax engine.

    "text": "CS 0451\nPerceptron Class Source Code: https://github.com/kate-kenny/kate-kenny.github.io/blob/main/posts/blog1/perceptron.py\nTo implement the perceptron algorithm, I used the above source code to create a perceptron class and perform perceptron updates. The specific update is performed using the fit() method of the class. I implimented the update based on the perceptron equation which is as follows:\n\\[\\textbf{w}^{(t+1)} = \\textbf{w}^{t} + \\mathcal{1}(y_i\\langle \\textbf{w}^{(t)},\\textbf{x}_{i} \\rangle > 0)y_i\\textbf{x}_i\\]\nThe fit() method takes two arguments, a matrix \\(X\\) of features and a vector \\(y\\) of labels. The method then generates a random weight vector, reffered to as \\(w\\) in my source code, and then iterates through the possible maximum number of steps to perform the perceptron update. The actual update occurs in the following way. As enumerated in the description of the algoritm, once we have a random set of weights \\(w\\) we generate a random integer \\(i\\). From there, we index the feature matrix \\(X\\) and the label vector \\(y\\) using that integer \\(i\\) and perform the update which is, in plain language, as follows. The weights in \\(w\\) will be updated if the dot product of the current weights and \\(x_i\\) multiplied by the actual label of the point, \\(y_i\\) is less than zero. In other words, the weights will be changed if the given weights do not corrently label the point \\(x_i\\). If that is the case, we add\n\n\n\nFor the first test case, we are going to run the model on a linearly seperable data set and display the line calculated by the perceptron algorithm to seperate the data points. To do this, I will use the source code provided in class to generate data and then create an instance of my own perceptron class. Finally, we will display the data and seperating line, along with a visual representation of the accuracy over time.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt2\n\n%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\n\nnp.random.seed()\n\nn = 100\np_features = 3\n\n#initialize X, y, a martix of features and vector of labels respectively\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 100, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1.7, -1.7), (1.7, 1.7)])\n\nplt.figure(1)\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\ntitle = plt.title(\"Test Case 1\")\n\nfrom perceptron import Perceptron\n\n#create instance of perceptron class and use the fit() method on X, y initialized above for the first test case\n\np = Perceptron()\np.fit(X,y)\n\n#draw line from weights found using perceptron algorithm\ndef draw_line(w, x_min, x_max):\n  x = np.linspace(x_min, x_max, 101)\n  y = -(w[0]*x + w[2])/w[1]\n  plt.plot(x, y, color = \"black\")\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nfig = draw_line(p.w, -2, 2)\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\nplt.figure(2)\nfig2 = plt.plot(p.history)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Iteration\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Accuracy\")\n\nThe autoreload extension is already loaded.

    "text": "Conclusion and Question\nFinally, I want to consider the question posed on the assignment page. What is the runtime complexity of a single iteration of the perceptron algorithm update as described by the update equation?\nRecall the update equation.\n\\[\\textbf{w}^{(t+1)} = \\textbf{w}^{t} + \\mathcal{1}(y_i\\langle \\textbf{w}^{(t)},\\textbf{x}_{i} \\rangle > 0)y_i\\textbf{x}_i\\]\nThe runtime of the equation is \\(O(1)*p\\) where \\(n\\) is the number of data points and \\(p\\) is the number of features. It doesn’t seem like the number of data points \\(n\\) would influence the runtime since a single update is only dealing with one randomly selected data point. So, for the update we need to assign the randomly selected points and corresponding weights. Then, for each update, we also take the dot product of each feature with it’s corresponding weight, which is \\(p\\) operations. Hence, we must multiply the runtime by \\(p\\)."

    "text": "In this blog, I will explore optimization for logistic regression through the implementation of three optimization algorithms: simple gradient descent, a momentum method, and stochastic gradient descent. Through experimentation we will compare the performance of each of these algoritms for training linear regression.\n\n\n\nFirst, we will implement standard gradient descent for logistic regression. This algorithm uses the following equation to calculate the gradient descent for \\(L(\\textbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}l(f_{\\textbf{w}}(\\textbf{x_i}),y_i)\\) that we derived in class.\n\\(\\nabla L(\\textbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(\\sigma (\\hat{y_i}) - y_i)\\textbf{x_i}}\\)\nMy approach to implementing this algorithm was somewhat similar to the way in which I implemented the perceptron algorithm last week. Similarly, the main method in my LogisticRegression class is a fit() method which takes in a matrix of features \\(X\\) and a vector of labels \\(y\\). The fit() method generates a random vector of weights, \\(w\\), and then updates that weight vector based on the gradient descent equation and update step. This results in an algorithm which can estimate the minimum of the loss function and as such gives a hyperplane (a line in our experiments) that can estimate the labels for data that is not linearly seperable.\n\nfrom logistic_regression import LogisticRegression # your source code\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nnp.seterr(all='ignore') \n\n\n%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n\n\n# make the data\np_features = 3\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 200, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1, -1), (1, 1)])\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\n#create instance of LogisticRegression Class and fit data \nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit(X, y, alpha=.001)\n\ndef draw_line(w, x_min, x_max):\n    x = np.linspace(x_min, x_max, 101)\n    y = -(w[0]*x + w[2])/w[1]\n    plt.plot(x, y, color = \"black\")\n\n#plot line using calculated weights \nfig = draw_line(LR.w, -2, 2)\n\nThe autoreload extension is already loaded.

Similar to the standard gradient descent algorithm used above, the stocashtic algorithm can be used to sort data that is not linearly seperable.\nInstead of computing the gradient as we did earlier, for this algorithm we compute the stochastic gradient by picking a random subset \\(S \\in [n]\\) and computing the following.\n\\(\\nabla L(\\textbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{|S|} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(\\sigma (\\hat{y_i}) - y_i)\\textbf{x_i}}\\)\nThe implementation of this algorithm is similar to that for gradient descent above but uses random batches of the data points and iterates through those batches to estimate the minimum of the loss function we are working with.\n\np_features = 3\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 200, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1, -1), (1, 1)])\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y)\n\ndef draw_line(w, x_min, x_max):\n    x = np.linspace(x_min, x_max, 101)\n    y = -(w[0]*x + w[2])/w[1]\n    plt.plot(x, y, color = \"black\")\n\n#plot line using calculated weights \nfig = draw_line(LR.w, -2, 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an illustration of the loss over epochs for the two algorithms implemented above: gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. Both have an alpha of .001 and have the maximum number of epochs set to 10,000.\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, \n                  max_epochs = 10000,  \n                  alpha = .001) \n\nnum_steps = len(LR.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.loss_history, label = \"stochastic gradient\")\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit(X, y, alpha = .001, max_epochs = 10000)\n\nnum_steps = len(LR.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.loss_history, label = \"gradient\")\n\nplt.loglog() \n\nlegend = plt.legend() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s examine a case where gradient descent does not converge because the selected alpha size is too large. Below is a plot of the loss of gradient descent with two different alpha values, .01 and 10. For this experiment, we are going to run the models on data with 10 feature dimensions.\n\n#Create data with 10 feature dimensions\np_features = 10\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 200, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1, -1), (1, 1)])\n\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit(X, y, alpha = 10, max_epochs = 10000)\n\nnum_steps = len(LR.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.loss_history, label = \"alpha = 10\")\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit(X, y, alpha = .01, max_epochs = 10000)\n\nnum_steps = len(LR.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.loss_history, label = \"alpha = .01\")\n\nplt.loglog() \n\nlegend = plt.legend() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur next experiment is the case where the batch size influences how quickly our algorithm (stochastic gradient descent) converges.

The points in this plot are colored by species, as seen in the legend. This plot highlights that there seems to be some trends in body mass and flipper length by species but the Adelie and Chinstrap penguins are quite similar while the Gentoo penguins have higher body mass and flipper length.\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nsns.set_theme()\n\nsns.relplot(data = train, \n           x = \"Body Mass (g)\", \n           y = \"Flipper Length (mm)\", \n           hue = \"Species\")\n\n<seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x7fe6f2df65b0>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s consider the below table which displays the number of penguines on each island by species. This is an interesting category to examine since two of the penguin species (Gentoo and Chinstrap) were only recorded on one island each while Adelie penguins were found on all three. This could be relevant to our prediction models since it could be easy to eliminate possible species when making predictions based on the island on which they were found. This leads me to believe Island will be a useful qualitative feature for our model.\n\ntrain.groupby([\"Species\", \"Island\"])[[\"Species\"]].count()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      Species\n    \n    \n      Species\n      Island\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\n      Biscoe\n      35\n    \n    \n      Dream\n      41\n    \n    \n      Torgersen\n      42\n    \n    \n      Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)\n      Dream\n      56\n    \n    \n      Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)\n      Biscoe\n      101\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#choose features and do cross validation\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# these are not actually all the columns: you'll \n# need to add any of the other ones you want to search for\nall_qual_cols = [\"Clutch Completion\", \"Sex\", \"Island\"]\nall_quant_cols = ['Culmen Length (mm)', 'Culmen Depth (mm)', 'Flipper Length (mm)', \"Body Mass (g)\"]\n\nfor qual in all_qual_cols: \n  qual_cols = [col for col in X_train.columns if qual in col ]\n  for pair in combinations(all_quant_cols, 2):\n    cols = qual_cols + list(pair) \n    print(cols)\n    # you could train models and score them here, keeping the list of \n    # columns for the model that has the best score. \n    # \n\n#Model Choices\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\n# this counts as 3 features because the two Clutch Completion \n# columns are transformations of a single original measurement. \n# you should find a way to automatically select some better columns\n# as suggested in the code block above\ncols = [\"Flipper Length (mm)\", \"Body Mass (g)\", \"Clutch Completion_No\", \"Clutch Completion_Yes\"]\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit(X_train[cols], y_train)\nLR.score(X_train[cols], y_train)\n\n#Plotting decision regions\nfrom mlxtend.plotting import plot_decision_regions\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef decision_region_panel(X, y, model, qual_features):  \n  p = len(qual_features)\n  fig, axarr = plt.subplots(1, p, figsize=(4*p,4))\n  for i in range(p):\n\n      filler_feature_values = {2+j: 0 for j in range(p)}\n\n      filler_feature_values.update({2+i: 1})\n\n      ix = X[qual_features[i]] == 1\n\n      ax = axarr[i]\n\n      plot_decision_regions(np.array(X[ix]), y[ix], clf=model,\n                            filler_feature_values=filler_feature_values,\n                            filler_feature_ranges={2+j: 0.1 for j in range(p)},\n                            legend=2, ax=ax)\n\n      ax.set_xlabel(X.columns[0])\n      ax.set_ylabel(X.columns[1])\n\n      handles, labels = ax.get_legend_handles_labels()\n      ax.legend(handles, \n          [\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\", \"Gentoo\"], \n           framealpha=0.3, scatterpoints=1)\n\n  # Adding axes annotations\n  fig.suptitle(f'Accuracy = {model.score(X, y).round(3)}')\n  plt.tight_layout()\n  plt.show()\n\nqual_features = [\"Clutch Completion_No\", \"Clutch Completion_Yes\"]\ndecision_region_panel(X_train[cols], y_train, LR, qual_features)\n\n['Clutch Completion_No', 'Clutch Completion_Yes', 'Culmen Length (mm)', 'Culmen Depth (mm)']\n['Clutch Completion_No', 'Clutch Completion_Yes', 'Culmen Length (mm)', 'Flipper Length (mm)']\n['Clutch Completion_No', 'Clutch Completion_Yes', 'Culmen Depth (mm)', 'Flipper Length (mm)']\n['Sex_FEMALE', 'Sex_MALE', 'Culmen Length (mm)', 'Culmen Depth (mm)']\n['Sex_FEMALE', 'Sex_MALE', 'Culmen Length (mm)', 'Flipper Length (mm)']\n['Sex_FEMALE', 'Sex_MALE', 'Culmen Depth (mm)', 'Flipper Length (mm)']\n\n\n/Users/katekenny/opt/anaconda3/envs/ml-0451/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/base.py:409: UserWarning: X does not have valid feature names, but LogisticRegression was fitted with feature names\n  warnings.warn(\n/Users/katekenny/opt/anaconda3/envs/ml-0451/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/base.py:409: UserWarning: X does not have valid feature names, but LogisticRegression was fitted with feature names\n  warnings.warn("

The specific update is performed using the fit() method of the class. I implimented the update based on the perceptron equation which is as follows:\n\\[\\textbf{w}^{(t+1)} = \\textbf{w}^{t} + \\mathcal{1}(y_i\\langle \\textbf{w}^{(t)},\\textbf{x}_{i} \\rangle > 0)y_i\\textbf{x}_i\\]\nThe fit() method takes two arguments, a matrix \\(X\\) of features and a vector \\(y\\) of labels. The method then generates a random weight vector, reffered to as \\(w\\) in my source code, and then iterates through the possible maximum number of steps to perform the perceptron update. The actual update occurs in the following way. As enumerated in the description of the algoritm, once we have a random set of weights \\(w\\) we generate a random integer \\(i\\). From there, we index the feature matrix \\(X\\) and the label vector \\(y\\) using that integer \\(i\\) and perform the update which is, in plain language, as follows. The weights in \\(w\\) will be updated if the dot product of the current weights and \\(x_i\\) multiplied by the actual label of the point, \\(y_i\\) is less than zero. In other words, the weights will be changed if the given weights do not corrently label the point \\(x_i\\). If that is the case, we add\n\n\nExperiment 1\nFor the first test case, we are going to run the model on a linearly seperable data set and display the line calculated by the perceptron algorithm to seperate the data points. To do this, I will use the source code provided in class to generate data and then create an instance of my own perceptron class. Finally, we will display the data and seperating line, along with a visual representation of the accuracy over time.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt2\n\n%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\n\nnp.random.seed()\n\nn = 100\np_features = 3\n\n#initialize X, y, a martix of features and vector of labels respectively\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 100, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1.7, -1.7), (1.7, 1.7)])\n\nplt.figure(1)\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\ntitle = plt.title(\"Test Case 1\")\n\nfrom perceptron import Perceptron\n\n#create instance of perceptron class and use the fit() method on X, y initialized above for the first test case\n\np = Perceptron()\np.fit(X,y)\n\n#draw line from weights found using perceptron algorithm\ndef draw_line(w, x_min, x_max):\n  x = np.linspace(x_min, x_max, 101)\n  y = -(w[0]*x + w[2])/w[1]\n  plt.plot(x, y, color = \"black\")\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nfig = draw_line(p.w, -2, 2)\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\nplt.figure(2)\nfig2 = plt.plot(p.history)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Iteration\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Accuracy\")\n\nThe autoreload extension is already loaded.

Then, I will use the fit() method to attempt to generate weights, \\(w\\), that will produce a line that will try and categorize the data.\nObviously, the algorithm will not converge but I will display the line generated to seperate the data after the full number of max steps has been concluded and also have a visualization of the accuracy throughout this process.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt2\n\n%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\n\nnp.random.seed()\n\nn = 100\np_features = 3\n\n#initialize X, y, a martix of features and vector of labels respectively\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 100, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1, -1), (.5,.5)])\n\nplt.figure(1)\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\ntitle = plt.title(\"Test Case 1\")\n\nfrom perceptron import Perceptron\n\n#create instance of perceptron class and use the fit() method on X, y initialized above for the first test case\n\np = Perceptron()\np.fit(X,y)\n\n#draw line from weights found using perceptron algorithm\ndef draw_line(w, x_min, x_max):\n  x = np.linspace(x_min, x_max, 101)\n  y = -(w[0]*x + w[2])/w[1]\n  plt.plot(x, y, color = \"black\")\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nfig = draw_line(p.w, -2, 2)\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\nplt.figure(2)\nfig2 = plt.plot(p.history)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Iteration\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Accuracy\")\n\nThe autoreload extension is already loaded.
